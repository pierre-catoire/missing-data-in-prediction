\title{Tune the intercept of a missingness model to match a target proportion}
\usage{
tune_missingness_intercept(
  target_missingness,
  beta_phi,
  theta,
  B = 50000,
  tol = 1e-04
)
}
\arguments{
\item{target_missingness}{Numeric scalar in \eqn{[0,1]}. Target marginal
probability of missingness.}

\item{beta_phi}{Numeric vector. Coefficients of the missingness model
excluding the intercept.}

\item{theta}{List. Parameters of the joint distribution of
\code{X1}, \code{X2}, and \code{Y}.}

\item{B}{Integer. Monte Carlo sample size used to approximate expectations.
Defaults to 50,000.}

\item{tol}{Numeric. Tolerance passed to the root-finding algorithm.}
}
\value{
Numeric scalar. Value of the intercept that approximately yields
  the target marginal missingness proportion.
}
\description{
Calibrates the intercept of a logistic missingness model so that the
marginal probability of missingness matches a prespecified target, under
the joint data-generating model defined by \code{theta}.
}
\details{
The intercept is obtained by solving a one-dimensional root-finding problem
using Monte Carlo integration and \code{uniroot()}. The Monte Carlo sample
is fixed during optimization to ensure numerical stability.

A large negative value is returned when \code{target_missingness == 0} to
avoid convergence issues.
