\title{Fit a Gaussian MLE model including missingness indicators}
\usage{
train_mlemi(dataset)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{Data frame containing variables \code{X1}, \code{X2},
\code{Y}, and the missingness indicator \code{MX1}.}
}
\value{
A list containing the estimated parameters of the joint Gaussian
model:
\describe{
  \item{mu}{Named numeric vector of estimated means.}
  \item{sigma}{Estimated covariance matrix.}
  \item{no_missingness_flag}{Logical. Indicates whether the estimation was
    performed without missingness indicators because no missing values were
    present in the data.}
}
}
\description{
Fits a multivariate normal model by maximum likelihood using the EM
algorithm, including missingness indicators as additional variables in the
joint model. This allows the estimation to account for informative
missingness through explicit modeling of the missingness process.
}
\details{
When no missingness is present in the dataset (\code{MX1 == 0} for all
observations), the function falls back to \code{train_mle()} and sets
\code{no_missingness_flag = TRUE}.

Otherwise, the missingness indicator \code{MX1} is included as an additional
variable in the joint Gaussian model, and parameters are estimated using the
EM algorithm implemented in \pkg{norm}.

This approach corresponds to likelihood-based estimation under a model that
explicitly incorporates missingness indicators.
