\title{Simulation study for prediction under missing data mechanisms}
\description{
This package contains the full simulation code used to evaluate prediction
methods under various missing data mechanisms. It implements data-generating
models with controlled missingness, multiple training procedures, oracle
reference predictors, and performance evaluation pipelines.
}
\details{
The code is designed for reproducibility and transparency, and accompanies
a methodological study on prediction under missing covariates.


The simulation framework includes:
\itemize{
  \item Generation of training and testing datasets with controlled
    missingness mechanisms.
  \item Estimation procedures based on complete cases, pattern submodels,
    likelihood-based methods, and multiple imputation.
  \item Oracle reference predictors computed under the true data-generating
    and missingness mechanisms.
  \item Evaluation of predictive performance using MSE and oracle-based
    MSEP criteria.
}

This package is not intended for general-purpose use and is distributed
solely for reproducibility of the simulation study.
