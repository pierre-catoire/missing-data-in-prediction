\title{Predict outcomes using pattern-specific submodels}
\usage{
predict_submodels(submodels, newdata)
}
\arguments{
\item{submodels}{Named list of fitted \code{lm} objects, typically produced
by \code{train_ps()} or \code{train_ccs()}. Names must correspond to
missingness patterns.}

\item{newdata}{Data frame containing covariates and the missingness
indicator \code{MX1}.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of predicted values, with length equal to the
  number of rows in \code{newdata}. Predictions are returned in the original
  row order.
}
\description{
Generates predictions by applying pattern-specific regression models to
the corresponding subsets of a dataset, as defined by the missingness
indicator \code{MX1}. Used both by Pattern Submodels and Complete Cases 
Submodels
}
\details{
For each unique value of \code{MX1} in \code{newdata}, predictions are
obtained using the corresponding submodel. If a missingness pattern is
present in \code{newdata} but no matching submodel is available, a warning
is issued and \code{NA} values are returned for observations with that
pattern.

\examples{
\dontrun{
predictions <- predict_submodels(submodels, data_test)
