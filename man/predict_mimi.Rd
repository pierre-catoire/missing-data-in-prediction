\title{Predict outcomes using multiple imputation with missingness indicators}
\usage{
predict_mimi(mimi_model, newdata)
}
\arguments{
\item{mimi_model}{List. Output of \code{train_mimi()}, containing imputation
models, prediction models, and the number of imputations.}

\item{newdata}{Data frame containing variables \code{X1}, \code{X2}, and the
missingness indicator \code{MX1}.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of pooled predictions of \code{Y}, with one entry
  per row of \code{newdata}.
}
\description{
Generates predictions of the outcome \code{Y} from models fitted on multiply
imputed datasets that explicitly incorporate missingness indicators, and
pools predictions across imputations by averaging.
}
\details{
For observations with missing \code{X1} (\code{MX1 == 1}), \code{X1} is
imputed within each imputed dataset prior to prediction. When imputation
models for missing \code{X1} are unavailable (i.e. no missingness was
present at estimation), a fallback imputation model fitted without
missingness indicators is used and a warning is issued.

Predictions of \code{Y} are then obtained from models that include
\code{MX1} as a predictor. Final predictions are computed by averaging
predictions across imputations. Coefficients are not pooled.
