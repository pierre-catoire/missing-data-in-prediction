\title{Train pattern-specific linear submodels}
\usage{
train_ps(dataset)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{Data frame containing outcome \code{Y}, covariates
\code{X1}, \code{X2}, and the missingness indicator \code{MX1}.}
}
\value{
A named list of fitted \code{lm} objects. Each element corresponds
  to a missingness pattern and is indexed by the character representation
  of the pattern (e.g. \code{"0"}, \code{"1"}).
}
\description{
Fits separate linear regression models for each observed missingness pattern
defined by the indicator \code{MX1}. For each pattern, the regression model
includes only the covariates observed under that pattern.
}
\details{
For each unique value of \code{MX1}, a separate linear model is fitted using
only observations belonging to that pattern. The set of predictors is
determined by the pattern: covariates with missingness indicators equal to
zero are included, while missing covariates are excluded from the model.

This corresponds to a pattern-mixture modeling approach in which both the
model structure and the fitted parameters may differ across missingness
patterns.
