\title{Predict outcomes from a Gaussian MLE model with missingness indicators}
\usage{
predict_mle_mi(mle_parameters, newdata)
}
\arguments{
\item{mle_parameters}{List. Output of \code{train_mle_mi()}, containing the
estimated mean vector \code{mu}, covariance matrix \code{sigma}, and the
logical flag \code{no_missingness_flag}.}

\item{newdata}{Data frame containing variables \code{X1}, \code{X2}, and the
missingness indicator \code{MX1}.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of predicted values of \code{Y}, with one entry per
  row of \code{newdata}.
}
\description{
Computes predictions of the outcome \code{Y} from a multivariate Gaussian
model fitted by maximum likelihood with missingness indicators included as
additional variables.
}
\details{
When \code{no_missingness_flag == TRUE}, predictions are obtained by calling
\code{predict_mle()} directly.

Otherwise, predictions are computed using conditional expectations under the
fitted joint Gaussian model:
\itemize{
  \item If \code{MX1 == 0}, predictions correspond to
    \eqn{E(Y \mid X_1, X_2, MX_1 = 0)}.
  \item If \code{MX1 == 1}, predictions correspond to
    \eqn{E(Y \mid X_2, MX_1 = 1)}.
}

The appropriate conditional expectation is applied observation-wise
according to the observed missingness pattern.
