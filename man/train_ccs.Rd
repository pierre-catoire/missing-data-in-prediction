\title{Train complete-case submodels by missingness pattern}
\usage{
train_ccs(dataset)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{Data frame containing outcome \code{Y}, covariates
\code{X1}, \code{X2}, and the missingness indicator \code{MX1}.}
}
\value{
A named list of fitted \code{lm} objects. Each element corresponds
  to a missingness pattern and is indexed by the character representation
  of the pattern.
}
\description{
Fits linear regression models for each missingness pattern defined by
\code{MX1}, using complete cases with respect to the covariates included
in the corresponding model.
}
\details{
For each missingness pattern, the set of predictors is determined in the
same way as in \code{train_ps()}, based on the observed covariates under
that pattern. However, model fitting is restricted to complete cases with
respect to the selected predictors.

This procedure corresponds to a complete-case analysis performed separately
within each missingness pattern.
