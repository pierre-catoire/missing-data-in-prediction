\title{Train prediction models using multiple imputation with missingness indicators}
\usage{
train_mimi(dataset, m = 5, method = "norm")
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{Data frame containing variables \code{X1}, \code{X2},
\code{Y}, and the missingness indicator \code{MX1}.}

\item{m}{Integer. Number of multiple imputations. Defaults to 5.}

\item{method}{Character. Imputation method passed to \code{mice()}.
Defaults to \code{"norm"}.}
}
\value{
A list with the following components:
\describe{
  \item{m}{Number of imputations.}
  \item{impModel}{List of imputation models for \code{X1} fitted on observations
    with \code{MX1 == 1}.}
  \item{impModelWithoutMI}{List of imputation models for \code{X1} fitted as if
    \code{X1} were always observed at training.}
  \item{predModel}{List of prediction models for \code{Y}, including
    \code{MX1} as a predictor, one per imputed dataset.}
}
}
\description{
Fits prediction models based on multiple imputation while explicitly
incorporating missingness indicators as predictors. This approach allows
the imputation and prediction stages to account for informative missingness.
}
\details{
Multiple imputation is performed using \pkg{mice}. The predictor matrix is
constructed so that missingness indicators are not themselves imputed and do
not act as predictors in the imputation models.

For each imputed dataset, a prediction model of \code{Y} on \code{X1},
\code{X2}, and \code{MX1} is fitted. Imputation models for \code{X1} are fitted
conditionally on \code{X2}, with special handling when no missingness is
present.

Predictions from these models are typically pooled at the prediction stage
rather than by pooling coefficients.
