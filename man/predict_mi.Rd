\title{Predict outcomes using multiple imputation models}
\usage{
predict_mi(mi_model, newdata)
}
\arguments{
\item{mi_model}{List. Output of \code{train_mi()}, containing imputation
models and prediction models for each imputed dataset.}

\item{newdata}{Data frame containing variables \code{X1}, \code{X2}, and the
missingness indicator \code{MX1}.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of pooled predictions of \code{Y}, with one entry
  per row of \code{newdata}.
}
\description{
Generates predictions of the outcome \code{Y} from a set of models fitted on
multiply imputed datasets, and pools predictions across imputations by
averaging.
}
\details{
For observations with missing \code{X1} (\code{MX1 == 1}), \code{X1} is first
imputed using the corresponding imputation model in each imputed dataset.
Predictions of \code{Y} are then obtained using the fitted prediction model
for that imputed dataset.

Final predictions are computed by averaging predictions across all
imputations. Coefficients are not pooled.
