\title{Train prediction models using multiple imputation}
\usage{
train_mi(dataset, m = 5, method = "norm")
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{Data frame containing variables \code{X1}, \code{X2}, and
\code{Y}, potentially with missing values.}

\item{m}{Integer. Number of multiple imputations. Defaults to 5.}

\item{method}{Character. Imputation method passed to \code{mice()}.
Defaults to \code{"norm"}.}
}
\value{
A list with the following components:
\describe{
  \item{m}{Number of imputations.}
  \item{impModel}{List of fitted imputation models for \code{X1}, one per
    imputed dataset.}
  \item{predModel}{List of fitted prediction models for \code{Y}, one per
    imputed dataset.}
}
}
\description{
Fits prediction models based on multiple imputation of missing values using
the \pkg{mice} framework. For each imputed dataset, a prediction model for
\code{Y} is fitted and stored.
}
\details{
Missing values are imputed using \code{mice()}. For each completed dataset,
an imputation model for \code{X1} conditional on \code{X2} and a prediction
model for \code{Y} conditional on \code{X1} and \code{X2} are fitted using
linear regression.

Predictions from these models are typically combined at the prediction
stage rather than by pooling coefficients.
