\title{Write performance results and LOESS-smoothed curves to CSV files}
\usage{
write_results_tables(
  tables,
  scenario,
  out_dir,
  loess_span = 0.75,
  loess_trim = c(0.02, 0.98),
  n_loess = 200
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tables}{List. Nested list of performance results as constructed during
the simulation loop. For each group and metric, results are indexed by the
target missingness proportion and contain both observed missingness and
performance values.}

\item{scenario}{Character scalar. Identifier of the missingness scenario.}

\item{out_dir}{Character scalar. Path to the directory where CSV files are
written.}

\item{loess_span}{Numeric. Span parameter passed to the LOESS smoother.
Defaults to 0.75.}

\item{loess_trim}{Numeric vector of length 2. Lower and upper quantiles used
to trim extreme values of the observed missingness proportion prior to
LOESS fitting. Defaults to \code{c(0.02, 0.98)}.}

\item{n_loess}{Integer. Number of points used to evaluate the LOESS-smoothed
curves. Defaults to 200.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{TRUE}. The primary effect of the function is
  writing CSV files to disk.
}
\description{
Writes raw performance results and LOESS-smoothed performance curves to
comma-separated value (CSV) files, for each missingness scenario, analysis
group, and performance metric.
}
\details{
For each combination of analysis group and performance metric, two CSV files
are produced:
\itemize{
  \item A raw performance file containing one row per simulation setting,
    with columns for observed missingness, target missingness, and the
    performance of each method.
  \item A LOESS-smoothed file containing smoothed performance curves for each
    method, evaluated on a common grid of observed missingness proportions.
}

LOESS smoothing is intended solely for visualization purposes and is applied
independently to each method. No aggregation or smoothing is performed prior
to this step.
